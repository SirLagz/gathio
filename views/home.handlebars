  <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 pb-2 text-center border-bottom">About Gathio</h2>

  <p class="lead text-center">Gathio is a simple, federated, privacy-first event hosting platform.</p>

  <div id="example-event" class="text-center w-100 mt-4 mb-5">
    <img
      alt="An example event page for a picnic. The page shows the event's location, host, date and time, and description, as well as buttons to save the event to Google Calendar, export it, and open the location in OpenStreetMap and Google Maps."
      src="images/example-event-2023.png" class="img-fluid w-75 mx-auto shadow-lg rounded">
  </div>

  <h3>Privacy-first</h3>

  <p>There are no accounts on Gathio. When you create an event, we generate a password which allows you to edit the
    event. Send all your guests the public link, and all your co-hosts the secret editing link containing the password.
  </p>

  <p>If you supply your email, we'll send you the editing password so you don't lose it - but supplying your email is
    optional!</p>

  <p>If this instance automatically deletes its events, sometime after the event finishes, it's deleted from the
    database for ever, and your data goes with it.</p>

  <p>Also, Gathio doesn't show you ads, doesn't sell your data, and never sends you unnecessary emails.</p>

  <p>But remember: all events are visible to anyone who knows the link, so probably don't use Gathio to plot your
    surprise birthday party or revolution. Or whatever, you do you.</p>

  <h3>Configurable</h3>

  <p>The <a href="https://gath.io">flagship Gathio instance at gath.io</a> is designed for anyone to create ephemeral,
    hidden events. Anyone can create an event; events are never displayed anywhere public; and they're deleted 7 days
    after they end.</p>

  <p>But if your community sets up their own instance, you can limit event creation to a specific list of people,
    display events on a handy list on the homepage, and disable event deletion entirely!</p>

  <h3>Federation and self-hosting</h3>

  <p>Gathio can easily be self-hosted, and supports ActivityPub services like Mastodon, Pleroma, and Friendica, allowing
    you to access events from anywhere on the Fediverse. We encourage you to spin up your own instance for your
    community. Detailed instructions on <a href="https://docs.gath.io/using-gathio/fediverse/">ActivityPub access</a>
    and <a href="https://docs.gath.io/running-gathio/installation/">self-hosted installation</a>
    live on our GitHub wiki.

  <h3>Open source</h3>

  <p>Gathio is delighted to be open source, and is built by a lovely group of people. Leave a question in our <a
      href="https://github.com/lowercasename/gathio/issues">tracker</a> if you encounter any issues.</p>
